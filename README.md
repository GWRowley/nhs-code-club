# NHS Code club

This repository is for the June 10th 2022 code club. 

This session will give a brief overview of SASS and CSS, a guide on using the existing components within the NHS toolkit, modifying other services toolkit components to work and be consitent with the NHS toolkit, and how to build your own custom components.

***Please note that all content in this 'tutorial' is built using the version of the toolkit prior to the 10th of June 2022, therefore if you are attempting to recreate the contents of this tutorial on a newer version of the toolkit after this date, results may vary!***
