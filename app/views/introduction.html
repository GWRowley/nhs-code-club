      <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

      <p>
        CSS stands for cascading style sheets, and in the simplest terms if I use the analogy of a website being a house, the brick work and beams are the HTML (the structure of the house / page); CSS is the paint work and furnishings, essentially what 'makes the house a home'. CSS is what makes a website 'look nice'.
      </p>

      <p>The cascading part - again in simple terms means that it reads from top to bottom, cascading down. Meaning if you have two classes of the same name, the property at 'the bottom' will be used. Using the example below if you applied the class <code>nhsuk-example-text</code> to a paragraph tag, the colour of the text would be blue as the bottom version of the class has overwritten the one above.</p>

      <pre><code>
      .nhsuk-example-text {
        color: green;
      }

      .nhsuk-example-text {
        color: blue;
      }
      </code></pre>
      <br>

      <h2>CSS Basics</h2>

      <p>In the above example, we mentioned classes. Classes are one of the ways we can target an element on a page and apply a style to it.</p>
      <p>However, this is not the only way we can style elements. We can also target specific HTML tags, and also the ID of an object.</p>
      <p>As a general rule, you should only use ID once per page - maybe for a header, or a footer, classes on the otherhand can be used many times on a page for example you might have a class that adds a width of 100px to an element, and you might want multiple elements to be 100px in width, so you would apply the relevant class name to each of the elements.</p>
      
      <h3>Examples</h3>

      <pre><code>
        p {
          color: red;
        }
      </code></pre> 

      <p>The above will target all paragraph tags (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) and turn them red.</p>

      <pre><code>
        p.red {
          color: red;
        }
      </code></pre> 

      <p>This example, will only target paragraph tags with the class of red applied (<code>&lt;p class="red"&gt;</code>)</p>

      <pre><code>
        #id {
          color: red;
        }

        .class {
          color: red;
        }
      </code></pre> 

      <p>This final example shows how you write CSS for an ID vs how you write CSS for a class. One starts with <code>#</code> and the other with a <code>.</code> character.</p>

      <h3>Best practices</h3>

      <p>Whilst prototypes are meant to be 'rough' it is still a good idea to get into the habbit of naming your classes something relevant.</p>

      <p>For example, if you are building your own component (something we will look at later) a class with name of <code>class1</code> could mean anything, whereas a class with the name of <code>header-title</code> is much more relevant and easier to identify if you ever need to make any adjustments.</p>
      
      <p>Furthermore, when it comes to naming classes, the NHS uses something called BEM. Which stands for block, element, modifier. Whilst probably not essential for protoytyping purposes it is something I would highly recommend learning for the reasons above. I personally found this <a href="https://codeburst.io/understanding-css-bem-naming-convention-a8cca116d252" target="_blank">blog post</a> (opens in a new tab) simple to understand and learn BEM for beginners.</p>

      <h2>SASS vs CSS</h2>

      <p>SASS is essentially a 'more powerful' version of CSS. SASS being a pre-processor of CSS. Syntax wise they are mostly the same, with the exception of 'powerful' features in SASS such as variables. SASS also allows you to 'nest' your code, which in my opinion leads to quicker development, cleaner code, and easier to maintain.</p>

      <p>Another major difference between the two is the file extension, SASS uses .scss whereas CSS uses the .css extension.</p>

      <p>When you write and save your SASS file, what essentially happens is (depending on what task runner / npm package used) the SASS is then converted to CSS, and also often concatenated into one file, and minified for better performance.</p>

      <p>Later on in this 'tutorial' will be details on creating your own SASS file, and more detail on the above.</p>

      <p>Using the house analogy again from earlier, here is a very basic example of SASS vs CSS, firstly we will look at how you might style a house using CSS:</p>

      <pre><code>
      .house {
        background-color: #FFA500;
      }

      .house .door {
        background-color: #000;
      }

      .house .windows {
        background-color: #FFF;
      }
      </code></pre>

      <p>If you were to write the above example in SASS you might write something like this:</p>

      <pre><code>
      $orange: #FFA500;
      $black: #000;
      $white: #FFF;

      .house {
        background-color: $orange;
        
        .door {
          background-color: $black;
        }

        .windows {
          background-color: $white;
        }
      }
      </code></pre>

      <p>With the use of variables in the second example for the colours, maybe later on you wanted to add a garage, you wouldn't have to remember the hex code for the colours simply the variable name, which in the long term makes developing quicker and easier.</p>
      <p>The nesting element of SASS I believe as it's visually similar to how you would write the HTML makes it easy to follow, and target elements for styling easier.</p>
      
      <p>For a much more in depth and better explained version of the above I would recommmend looking at the <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide" target="_blank">SASS official guide</a> (opens in a new tab). Some of the other features will also be discussed further on in this tutorial.</p>
